    "In this section, we address the core architectural decisions of the cryptocurrency design based on the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a unit of currency.\n",
    "2. the details of any transaction in terms of what needs to be recorded. \n",
    "3. a method for certifying ownership and authorizing transactions.  Basically this involves a signing algorithms.\n",
    "4. how you will avoid the \"double spending\" problem by setting up a mechanism for users to verify a unit of currency is actually available.  Blockchain is the mechanism Bitcoin uses.t\n",
    "5. how currency is to be generated, typically this would be in terms of users offering some sort of service.  For example the \"mining\" of Bitcoins is done by verifying transactions on its Blockchain.\n",
    "6. any other issues specific to your design."

    "## 1. Unit of Currency: Dynamic Precision Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid fixing a permanent minimum unit of currency, we allow divisibility to\n",
    "increase as the network grows. If the currency becomes more valuable, users\n",
    "naturally need smaller units. Instead of performing a redenomination, we tie\n",
    "the number of allowed decimal places to the block difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule:**  \n",
    "Allowed decimal places = difficulty of the latest block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:  \n",
    "- difficulty = 0 → 50  \n",
    "- difficulty = 2 → 50.00  \n",
    "- difficulty = 5 → 50.00000  \n",

    "## 2. Transaction Data Details & Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we implement two types of transactions. Each field serves a critical role in ensuring security, consensus, and state management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Account Transaction (`AccountTx`)\n",
    "Standard peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transfer used for value exchange between users.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **sender** (`str`): The wallet address of the sender.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Identifies which account balance should be debited in the Global State.\n",
    "* **recipient** (`str`): The wallet address of the receiver.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Identifies which account balance should be credited.\n",
    "* **amount** (`Decimal`): The quantity of CryptoCoin to transfer.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Represents the actual economic value moving between accounts. This is validated against the sender's current balance.\n",
    "* **fee** (`Decimal`): The transaction fee paid to the miner.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Incentivizes miners to prioritize this transaction (Fee Market) and acts as an economic cost barrier to prevent spam (DoS) attacks.\n",
    "* **nonce** (`int`): A strictly increasing counter specific to the sender's account.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Crucial for preventing **Replay Attacks**. It ensures that a signed transaction cannot be intercepted and broadcasted multiple times to drain funds.\n",
    "* **timestamp** (`float`): The creation time of the transaction.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Ensures temporal integrity by preventing transactions from being broadcasted with timestamps too far in the future or past (Drift Check).\n",
    "* **signature** (`hex`): The Ed25519 digital signature of the transaction data.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Cryptographically proves that the `sender` actually authorized this transaction and ensures the data has not been tampered with (Integrity).\n",
    "* **pubkey** (`hex`): The raw public key of the sender.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Since the `sender` address is a hash, the raw public key must be revealed to verify the `signature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Coinbase Transaction (`CoinbaseTx`)\n",
    "A special transaction generated by the system to reward miners.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **recipient** (`str`): The address of the miner who solved the PoW puzzle.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* Designates the beneficiary of the block reward and accumulated transaction fees.\n",
    "* **amount** (`Decimal`): The sum of the Block Reward (e.g., 50 CC) and total fees from transactions in the block.\n",
    "    * *Why needed:* This is the sole mechanism for **Minting** (creating new currency supply) and provides the economic incentive for securing the network."

    "## 3. Certification Method: Ed25519 Signatures\n",
    "\n",
    "To secure user funds and authorize state transitions without a central authority, this system utilizes **Public Key Cryptography**. We specifically employ the **Ed25519** signature scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Signing Algorithm: Ed25519\n",
    "Instead of the traditional ECDSA used by Bitcoin (secp256k1), we use the **Ed25519** (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm).\n",
    "* **Why Ed25519?**:\n",
    "    * **Performance:** It offers faster signing and verification speeds compared to ECDSA.\n",
    "    * **Security:** It is designed to be immune to side-channel attacks that plague standard ECDSA implementations.\n",
    "    * **Compactness:** It uses small 32-byte public keys, reducing storage requirements on the blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Certifying Ownership (Wallet & Address)\n",
    "Ownership of funds is defined by the possession of a **Private Key**. The system does not store \"accounts\" like a bank; it tracks balances assigned to \"Addresses.\"\n",
    "* **Private Key (`sk`)**: A randomly generated secret that must be kept secure. It allows the user to spend funds.\n",
    "* **Public Key (`vk`)**: Derived mathematically from the private key. It is shared with the network to verify signatures.\n",
    "* **Address Generation**: The user's address is a hashed version of the Public Key.\n",
    "    * `Address = Base58Check( RIPEMD160( SHA256( Public Key ) ) )`\n",
    "    * **Why:** Hashing provides an extra layer of security (quantum resistance until the first spend) and creates a shorter, human-readable format for receiving funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Authorizing Transactions (Digital Signatures & Nonce)\n",
    "When a user wants to transfer funds, they must prove they own the address without revealing their private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Signing (Sender side):**\n",
    "    * The user creates a transaction message including the **current Nonce** (e.g., 0).\n",
    "    * The `Wallet` class uses the **Private Key** to generate a cryptographic **Signature** of this message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Verification (Network side):**\n",
    "    * Nodes check two conditions before accepting the transaction:\n",
    "        1.  **Identity:** Does `Hash(Public Key)` match the `Sender Address`?\n",
    "        2.  **Integrity:** Is the `Signature` valid for this message using the `Public Key`?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Replay Protection (Nonce Check):**\n",
    "    * Even if the signature is valid, the system compares the transaction's `nonce` with the sender's current state in the ledger.\n",
    "    * **Rule:** `Tx Nonce` must equal `Account Nonce`.\n",
    "    * **Update:** If valid, the account's nonce is incremented by 1 (`Nonce += 1`).\n",
    "    * **Why:** This strict ordering prevents attackers from re-broadcasting an old, already-signed transaction to spend funds multiple times (Replay Attack)."

    "## 4. Double Spending Prevention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "Double spending is the risk that a digital currency holder could spend the same unit of currency more than once. Since digital tokens are just data, they can be easily duplicated. To prevent this, our system employs a multi-layered verification mechanism centered around the **Blockchain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Verification of Available Funds (State Check)\n",
    "The primary mechanism to verify if a unit of currency is actually available is the **Global State Ledger**.\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** Unlike physical cash, our system maintains a `StateManager` that tracks the exact balance of every address.\n",
    "* **The Check:** Before any transaction is accepted, the `TransactionValidator` performs a strict check: `Sender Balance >= Amount + Fee`.\n",
    "* **Result:** If a user attempts to spend funds they have already used in a previous transaction (which reduced their recorded balance), this check fails, and the transaction is rejected immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Ordering via Nonces\n",
    "To prevent a user from broadcasting two conflicting transactions simultaneously (e.g., spending the same 50 coins to Bob and Charlie at the same time):\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** Every account has a strictly increasing counter called a `nonce`.\n",
    "* **The Check:** The system enforces that `Tx.Nonce == Account.Current_Nonce`.\n",
    "* **Result:** Once the first transaction is accepted, the account's nonce increments. Any subsequent attempt to re-use that nonce for a double-spend transaction will be rejected as invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Global Consensus (Proof-of-Work)\n",
    "In a distributed network, different nodes might see conflicting transactions at different times. The **Blockchain** serves as the final arbiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mechanism:** Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle (Proof-of-Work) to seal transactions into a block.\n",
    "* **Resolution:** If two conflicting transactions make it into competing blocks (a fork), the network adopts the **Longest Chain Rule**. Only the transaction in the longest chain is considered valid history; the other is discarded, ensuring the currency is spent only once."

    "## 5. Currency Generation: Mining & Coinbase\n",
    "\n",
    "In this system, currency is not issued by a central bank but is generated algorithmically through a process called **Mining**. This aligns with the principle that currency should be earned by providing a valuable service to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The Service: Security & Validation\n",
    "Miners provide the critical service of maintaining the ledger's integrity.\n",
    "* **Validation:** They collect pending transactions from the Mempool, verify their digital signatures, and ensure no double-spending occurs.\n",
    "* **Security (Proof-of-Work):** They expend computational energy (CPU power) to solve a cryptographic puzzle (finding a hash below a specific target). This work secures the blockchain history against tampering, as rewriting the history would require re-doing all the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The Reward: Coinbase Transaction\n",
    "As compensation for this service, the protocol allows the miner to include a special transaction called the **Coinbase Transaction** at the beginning of the block.\n",
    "* **Minting:** This transaction has no sender (input) and creates new coins out of thin air.\n",
    "* **Components:**\n",
    "    * **Block Reward:** A fixed amount (e.g., 50 CC) minted per block.\n",
    "    * **Transaction Fees:** The sum of fees from all transactions included in the block.\n",
    "    \n",

    "## 6. Design-Specific Issues & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "This prototype demonstrates the core mechanics of a blockchain, but specific design choices and the nature of a \"Toy Model\" introduce certain limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Sequential Transaction Processing (Strict Ordering)\n",
    "Our implementation enforces a strict rule where `Tx.Nonce` must exactly match the `Account.Nonce` stored in the committed ledger state.\n",
    "* **The Constraint:** Transactions must be processed strictly in order (Nonce 0, 1, 2...).\n",
    "* **Impact:** This creates a concurrency bottleneck known as **Head-of-Line Blocking**. If a user broadcasts `Tx #0` (Low Fee) and `Tx #1` (High Fee), the network cannot process `Tx #1` until `Tx #0` is confirmed, regardless of the higher fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data Persistence (Volatile Memory)\n",
    "Currently, the `StateManager` stores all account balances and nonces in Python dictionaries (RAM).\n",
    "* **The Issue:** The system lacks a persistent storage layer (like LevelDB or RocksDB).\n",
    "* **Impact:** If the node software terminates or crashes, the entire ledger state is lost. Furthermore, as the blockchain grows, the memory requirement scales linearly, eventually exceeding available RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Network Layer Abstraction\n",
    "The simulation models P2P networking via direct method calls between objects in a single process (e.g., `node_B.receive_chain(node_A)`).\n",
    "* **The Issue:** It lacks a true network stack (TCP/IP, Socket).\n",
    "* **Impact:** Real-world challenges such as network latency, packet loss, and peer discovery are not simulated, which are critical factors in actual consensus convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Mining Algorithm Efficiency\n",
    "The Proof-of-Work loop is implemented in pure Python.\n",
    "* **The Issue:** Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and interpreted nature make the mining process significantly slower than C++ or hardware (ASIC) implementations.\n",
    "* **Impact:** This makes the current prototype unsuitable for high-difficulty environments, serving primarily as an educational demonstration of the consensus logic."
